## Introduction

Throughout my 25-year career in IT infrastructure, I've witnessed the evolution from physical servers to virtualization, and now to cloud-native architectures. As a cloud architect who has worked extensively at Broadcom (formerly VMware/Pivotal), I understand the critical importance of mastering different IaaS platforms. This blog series documents my complete journey of building an enterprise-grade CloudStack VXLAN lab on the Kamatera cloud platform.

## Why This Series?

### Technical Motivation

In modern cloud architectures, network virtualization has become a cornerstone technology. However, most CloudStack tutorials still focus on traditional VLAN configurations. When I decided to deep-dive into CloudStack's VXLAN + BGP EVPN implementation, I found that practical, hands-on documentation was extremely scarce. This motivated me to document the entire implementation process and contribute a comprehensive technical guide to the community.

### Challenges and Opportunities

Building a CloudStack lab on public cloud presents numerous challenges:

- **Network Limitations**: Kamatera's Layer 2 network doesn't support VLAN tagging
- **Resource Optimization**: Achieving enterprise features while controlling costs
- **Technical Complexity**: Integrating VXLAN, BGP EVPN with CloudStack requires deep networking knowledge
- **Lab Environment**: Creating a platform that's both production-like and learning-friendly

## Project Overview

### Architecture Vision

![Target Architecture](/images/target-architecture.png)

Our goal is to build a complete CloudStack environment with the following characteristics:

- **Modern Network Architecture**: VXLAN replacing traditional VLANs
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent routing using BGP EVPN
- **High Availability Design**: 3 Hypervisor nodes ensuring redundancy
- **Secure Access**: Remote management through OpenVPN
- **Cost Optimization**: Simulating enterprise environment on public cloud

### Technology Stack

After thorough evaluation, I selected the following technology combination:

```yaml
Infrastructure Layer:
  Cloud Platform: Kamatera Cloud
  Network: Layer 2 Private Network (192.168.1.0/24)
  
Network Layer:
  Software Router: VyOS 1.5.x Stream Edition
  Protocols: BGP, VXLAN, EVPN
  VPN: OpenVPN Access Server
  
Compute Layer:
  IaaS Platform: Apache CloudStack 4.21.0.0
  Operating System: Rocky Linux 9
  Hypervisor: KVM
  
Management Layer:
  Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
  Logging: ELK Stack
  Automation: Ansible + Terraform
```

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Network Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

The initial challenge was implementing complex network topology within Kamatera's constraints. After multiple attempts, I realized the need for an intermediate layer to handle all network functions.

**Key Decision Points:**
- Choosing VyOS as the networking Swiss Army knife
- Designing router-on-a-stick architecture for all traffic
- Implementing SNAT to ensure internal connectivity

### Phase 2: VyOS Configuration Optimization (Week 3)

VyOS configuration proved more complex than expected, particularly when handling:
- VXLAN tunnel endpoints
- BGP peering configuration
- OpenVPN and internal routing integration

**Breakthrough Moment**: When I successfully established the first VXLAN tunnel and saw BGP routes propagating correctly, the entire architecture's feasibility was validated.

### Phase 3: CloudStack Integration (Weeks 4-5)

Integrating CloudStack with the VXLAN network was the most challenging part:

```
Challenge Checklist:
â–¡ CloudStack network plugin configuration
â–¡ VXLAN to physical network mapping
â–¡ BGP EVPN control plane integration
â–¡ Multi-tenant isolation verification
â–¡ Performance optimization and tuning
```

### Phase 4: Production-Grade Optimization (Week 6)

The final phase focused on elevating the lab environment to near-production quality:
- Implementing monitoring and alerting
- Configuring automated backups
- Performance benchmarking
- Security hardening

## Technical Breakthroughs and Innovations

### 1. Virtual VLAN Implementation

Since Kamatera doesn't support VLAN tagging, I developed an innovative solution:

```
Traditional Approach: Physical Switch â†’ VLAN Tags â†’ CloudStack
My Solution: VyOS Bridge â†’ Virtual VLAN â†’ VXLAN Mapping â†’ CloudStack
```

### 2. BGP EVPN in Constrained Environments

Implementing BGP EVPN without physical switch support required creative thinking:

- Using VyOS as virtual Route Reflector
- Implementing software-defined VTEPs
- Achieving multi-tenant routing isolation through eBGP

### 3. Performance Optimization Strategies

Achieved near bare-metal network performance through:

- **CPU Affinity**: Binding network interrupts to specific CPU cores
- **DPDK Acceleration**: Enabling userspace networking on supported components
- **Cache Optimization**: Tuning Linux network stack parameters

## Key Learnings

### Architectural Thinking

This project reinforced several architectural principles:

- **Simplifying Complexity**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
